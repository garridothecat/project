/**The provided code appears to be a React component written in TypeScript that renders a simple background with multiple images of pokeballs. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. Import Statements:
   - Two images, `pokeball1` and `pokeball2`, are imported from their respective file paths in the `../assets` directory. These images are presumably PNG files.

2. Exported Function:
   - The `Background` component is exported as the default export of this module.

3. JSX Component:
   - The `Background` component returns JSX, describing the structure and content of the component.

4. HTML Structure:
   - The component renders a `<div>` element with a `className` of "background." This is likely used for styling purposes.

5. Pokeball Images:
   - Inside the `<div>`, multiple `<img>` elements are rendered.
   - Each `<img>` element represents a pokeball image. The `src` attribute is set to either `pokeball1` or `pokeball2`, which correspond to the imported images.
   - The `alt` attribute is an empty string, which is not recommended for accessibility. A more meaningful description of the image should be provided for accessibility reasons.
   - Each `<img>` element has a `className` assigned in the format "pokeball pokeball-x," where "x" is a number from 1 to 6. These class names are likely used for applying CSS styles to each pokeball individually.

Overall, this component is a simple React component that renders a background consisting of multiple pokeball images. It's a static representation, and you can style it with CSS to position the pokeballs and control their appearance. */
