/**The provided code is a React functional component called `Loader`. This component is used to display a loading animation, which appears to be a spinning Pokéball, typically shown to users while waiting for content to load. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Imports**:
   - The code imports React and an image named `pokeballLoader` from the specified file path. The image is presumably a GIF representing a loading animation.

2. **Function Declaration**:
   - The `Loader` function is declared as a functional component.

3. **Function Body**:
   - Inside the `Loader` function, the component is defined.

4. **JSX Element**:
   - The component returns a `<div>` element with a class name of "loader."
   - Inside this `<div>`, an `<img>` element is rendered. The `src` attribute of the `<img>` element is set to the `pokeballLoader` image, and the `alt` attribute is an empty string (which is not recommended for accessibility; a more meaningful description should be provided).

5. **Export**:
   - The `Loader` component is exported as the default export of this module, making it available for use in other parts of the application.

This `Loader` component can be used to show a loading animation on your website or application when content is being fetched or processed. When this component is used in a React application, it will display the Pokéball loader GIF on the screen. */
