/**The provided code is a React component called "MyList." This component appears to be part of a larger web application and is related to user-specific Pokémon content. Let's break down the key elements of this code:

1. **React and Dependencies**: The code imports React, as well as several custom components and functions, including `Wrapper`, `Login`, `useAppDispatch`, and `useAppSelector`. It also imports actions from Redux reducers.

2. **State Access**: Inside the `MyList` component, it uses the `useAppSelector` hook to access the Redux store's state from two different slices of the store:
   - It extracts the `userInfo` property from the `app` slice of the Redux store.
   - It also extracts the `userPokemons` property from the `pokemon` slice of the Redux store. This suggests that the component is meant to display a list of Pokémon that belong to the currently logged-in user.

3. **Redux Dispatch**: The component uses the `useAppDispatch` hook to obtain the dispatch function, which is used to trigger Redux actions. In this case, it dispatches the `getUserPokemons` action when the component mounts or when there are changes to the `userInfo` or `dispatch` dependencies.

4. **`useEffect` Hook**: The `useEffect` hook is used to run side effects when the component mounts. In this case, it dispatches the `getUserPokemons` action, which presumably fetches the Pokémon data associated with the currently logged-in user.

5. **Rendering**: The component's render method returns JSX (JavaScript XML) code, which defines the structure and content of the component's user interface. It includes:
   - A `<div>` element with the class name "list." This is a container for the content to be displayed.

   - A conditional rendering: If `userInfo` is truthy (indicating that the user is logged in), it renders a `PokemonCardGrid` component and passes the `userPokemons` as a prop. This likely displays a grid of Pokémon cards belonging to the user.
   - If `userInfo` is falsy, it renders a `Login` component, suggesting that the user needs to log in to access their list of Pokémon.

6. **Export**: The component is exported as the default export of the module. It is also wrapped with the `Wrapper` component. This implies that the `Wrapper` component may provide additional functionality, styling, or layout to the "MyList" component. `Wrapper` is likely a higher-order component (HOC).

In summary, the "MyList" component is designed to display a list of Pokémon specific to the logged-in user. It accesses user-related information and Pokémon data from the Redux store, and it conditionally renders either a grid of user-owned Pokémon or a login component, depending on whether the user is logged in. The use of the `Wrapper` component suggests that it may provide a consistent layout or styling to the component. */
