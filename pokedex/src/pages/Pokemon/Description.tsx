/**The provided code is another React component named "Description." This component appears to be part of a larger React application and is used for displaying information about a Pokémon. Let's break down the key elements of this code:

1. **React and Redux**: The code begins by importing React and a few custom components, including "Info" and "PokemonContainer." It also imports the `useAppSelector` hook from "../../app/hooks," which is used to access the Redux state.

2. **Component Function**: The `Description` function is defined as a React functional component. It takes no props but relies on Redux to access the data it needs.

3. **State Access**: Inside the component function, it uses the `useAppSelector` hook to access the Redux state. It targets the `currentPokemon` property within the `pokemon` slice of the Redux store. This suggests that the component is designed to display information about the currently selected Pokémon.

4. **Rendering**: The component's render method returns JSX (JavaScript XML) code, which defines the structure and content of the component's user interface. It includes:

   - An empty fragment (`<>...</>`) that allows you to return multiple elements without a wrapping container.

   - The "Info" component is rendered and provided with the `data` prop, which is set to the `pokemonData` retrieved from the Redux store. This component is likely responsible for displaying general information about the Pokémon, such as its name, type, and other details.

   - A conditional rendering of the "PokemonContainer" component. It checks if `pokemonData` is truthy (not null or undefined) and, if so, renders the "PokemonContainer" component, passing the `image` property from `pokemonData`. This component likely displays the image of the Pokémon.

5. **Export**: The component is exported as the default export of the module, making it available for use in other parts of the application.

In summary, the "Description" component is used to display information about a Pokémon. It accesses the relevant Pokémon data from the Redux store, passes that data to child components, and conditionally renders a container for displaying the Pokémon's image. This structure allows for a modular and organized way of displaying Pokémon information in the larger application. */
