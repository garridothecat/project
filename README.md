## Getting Started

To get started with the Pokedex website, you can visit our live website at [www.pokedexwebsite.com](https://www.pokedexwebsite.com). There's no need to install anything, and you can start exploring Pokemon right away.

## Features

### 1. Explore the Pokedex

The heart of our website is the Pokedex itself. You can search for and explore information about all the known Pokemon species. Learn about their types, abilities, base stats, and more. Each Pokemon's page provides detailed information and even allows you to see their in-game sprites.

### 2. Create Your Team

To create your dream Pokemon team, you can register an account and start building your team. You can select Pokemon from the Pokedex, give them nicknames, and customize their movesets. Save your team for future reference, or share it with other trainers.

### 3. Compare Pokemon

Want to know which Pokemon is the better choice for your team? Our website allows you to compare two or more Pokemon side by side. Compare base stats, abilities, types, and even visualize type effectiveness charts. This feature helps you make informed decisions when building your team.
